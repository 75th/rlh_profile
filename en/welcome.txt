<h1 class="title">Welcome to your new Pleth Drupal website!</h1>


<strong>Step 1. Start publishing content</strong>

Start <a href="[[node/add]]">creating content</a> for your site. Depending on which modules you have activated, you may see blogs, forums, polls and more as available content types.

<p>Some optional configuration tasks are shown below. For more information, please refer to the built-in <a href="[[admin/help]]">help section</a>, or the <a href="http://drupal.org/handbooks">online Drupal handbooks</a>.</p>

<strong>Choose a different design</strong>

Start by <a href="[[admin/appearance/settings/bartik]]">changing the colors</a> of the default theme.  To change the fundamental "look and feel" of your website, visit the <a href="[[admin/appearance]]">appearance section</a> and choose a theme from one of the many themes available out-of-the-box.

Many additional Drupal 7.x compatible themes are available on Drupal.org in the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/Themes">Drupal themes download section</a>, which you can install <a href="[[admin/appearance]]">through your themes page</a>.

<strong>Configure the front page</strong>

The default front page is a listing of all content marked as <q>Promoted to front page</q>.  You can manage your content from the <a href="[[admin/content]]">content administration page</a>. You can also designate, for example, an item of content you have created as the front page. See the <a href="[[admin/config/system/site-information]]">site information settings page</a> to configure the default front page path.  You can also edit you site name and add a slogan to make the site your own.
